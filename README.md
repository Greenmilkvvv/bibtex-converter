# Introduction

This is a simple tool to transfer a reference with form of string to bibtex. Only the reference string and a cite-key are needed.

## Why to use it

Sometimes, we need to cite a reference in a paper, but we don't have the bibtex file. In websites like CNKI, we can only get a reference string. This tool can help us to get the bibtex. 

## How to use it

```python
from bibtex_converter import *
```
